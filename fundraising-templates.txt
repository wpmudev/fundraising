You can create new files inside your active theme's root folder to be used when displaying a fundraiser.

There are 3 types of templates you can create.

== Custom Template Functions ==
You can change the location of the template-functions that are loaded in fundraising to an external location.
This will insure that any custom changes you make to your template functions are not broken when updating the plugin in the future.

Add a new define statement in your wp-config.php file containing a string pointing to the location.
define('WDF_CUSTOM_TEMPLATE_FUNCTIONS','/full-server-path/and/filename.php');


== Custom Styles ==
Add any CSS file to your fundraising /styles/ folder for it to be available in your settings.

You can also create a folder named "wdf-styles" in your wp-content folder 
OR 
you can set an external location using the following code in your wp-config.php file.

define('WDF_EXTERNAL_STYLE_DIRECTORY','/full/server/path/to/styles/')

By default the name of the style is the name of the file.  You can manually adjust this using the "wdf_custom_style_name" filter

Exmaple:
add_filter('wdf_custom_style_name', 'my_custom_filter_style_name', 10, 2);

function my_custom_filter_style_name($name, $file_name) {
	if($file_name == 'my-file.css') {
		$name = "My Custom Style";
	}
	return $name;
}
